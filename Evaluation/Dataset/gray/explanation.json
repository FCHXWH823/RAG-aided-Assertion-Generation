    "logical expression": "rst || sig == 1",
    "Signals": ["rst", "sig"],
    "Signal Explanations": {
      "rst": "asynchronous reset input used to initialize and reset the counter logic",

    "Logical Operators": ["s_eventually", "||", "=="],
    "Logical Operators Explanation": {
      "s_eventually": "a temporal operator requiring that the contained condition eventually holds true at some future clock cycle",
      "||": "logical OR operator meaning that at least one of the contained conditions must be true",
      "==": "equality operator indicating that the compared value must be exactly equal to a constant"
    },
    "Assertion Explaination": "eventually, either the asynchronous reset input is active or the output signal that indicates a zero value in the Gray-coded counter is equal to one; that is, at some future clock cycle, it must hold that one of these conditions is satisfied"
  }
