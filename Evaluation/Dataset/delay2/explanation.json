"Signal Explanations": {
          "rst": "the reset signal that reinitializes the counter when active",
          "sig": "the output signal that is set to 1 when the counter exceeds the parameter N"

"Logical Operators": ["||", "==", "s_eventually"],
"Logical Operators Explanation": {
          "||": "logical OR operator that results true if at least one of its operands is true",
          "==": "equality operator that checks if two values are identical",
          "s_eventually": "a temporal operator indicating that the contained condition is required to occur at some future clock cycle"
},
"Assertion Explaination": "ensures that eventually either the condition of the reset being active is met or the condition of the output signal matching the active state is satisfied, meaning that either a reset occurs or the delayed output becomes active"
