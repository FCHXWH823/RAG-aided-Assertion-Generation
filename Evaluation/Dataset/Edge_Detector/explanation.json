"Assertion 1": {
"clock signal condition": "@(posedge clk)",
"disable condition": "disable iff (~resetn)",
"logical expression": "$rose(din_f_q) == dout",
"Signals": ["din_f_q", "dout"],
"Signal Explanations": {
  "din_f_q": "a register that holds the delayed version of the input used to check for a low-to-high transition",
  "dout": "the output signal that produces a one-cycle pulse following the detection of a rising edge"
},
"Logical Operators": ["$rose", "=="],
"Logical Operators Explanation": {
  "$rose": "evaluates to true when its argument transitions from low to high, indicating a rising edge",
  "==": "compares two values to determine if they are equal"
},
"Assertion Explaination": "if the delayed input signal experiences a low-to-high transition then the one-cycle pulse generating signal must be asserted"
}
