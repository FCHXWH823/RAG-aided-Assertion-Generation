    "Signals": ["din_f_q", "dout"],
    "Signal Explanations": {
      "din_f_q": "stored copy of the incoming data signal used to check for a rising edge",
      "dout": "output signal that represents the generated pulse after edge detection"

    "Logical Operators Explanation": {
      "$rose": "a function that checks for a transition from low (0) to high (1) over successive clock cycles",
      "==": "an operator that tests for the equality of its two operands"
    },
    "Assertion Explaination": "if a transition from low to high is detected in the stored copy of the incoming data signal SINCE THE LAST CLOCK CYCLE, then the result of that rising edge detection is equal to the generated pulse output"
