"Logical Operators": ["$rose", "|->", "##2"],
"Logical Operators Explanation": {
  "$rose": "a function that returns true if the referenced signal transitions from 0 to 1 in the current clock cycle",
  "|->": "an overlapping implication operator meaning that if the conditions on the left are met then the condition on the right must hold SINCE THE SAME CLOCK CYCLE",
  "##2": "a delay operator indicating that the condition following it should occur after 2 clock cycles"
},
"Assertion Explaination": "when request signal is detected to have a rising edge, then after a delay of 2 clock cycles the acknowledge signal is detected to have a rising edge"
}
