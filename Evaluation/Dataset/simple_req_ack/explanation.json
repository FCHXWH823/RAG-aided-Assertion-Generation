"Logical Operators Explanation": {
  "$rose": "detects when a signal makes a rising (positive) transition",
  "|->": "non-overlapping implication, meaning if the antecedent is true the consequent must hold after the specified delay",

},
"Assertion Explaination": "if a rising edge is detected on the input request signal, then two clock cycles later a rising edge must be detected on the output acknowledgement signal"
