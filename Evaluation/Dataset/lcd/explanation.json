    "Signal Explanations": {
      "lcd_enable": "indicates whether an LCD command should be transmitted (active high triggers a new transfer)",
      "state": "represents the current state of the LCD controller FSM, with a value of 2 meaning that initialization is complete and the module is ready to accept new commands"

    "Logical Operators Explanation": {
      "s_eventually": "a temporal operator indicating that the contained condition is required to occur at some future clock cycle",
      "==": "evaluates equality between two values",
      "||": "a logical OR operator that is true if at least one of its operands is true"

    "Assertion Explaination": "eventually the condition will be met that either the signal for triggering an LCD command is inactive (0) or the condition indicating that the controller is in the ready state (state equal to the ready value) holds"
