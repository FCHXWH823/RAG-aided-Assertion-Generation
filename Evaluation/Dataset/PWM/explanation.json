"Assertion 1": {
"clock signal condition": "@(posedge clk)",
"disable condition": "",
"logical expression": "1 |-> s_eventually(~pulse)",
"Signals": ["pulse"],
"Signal Explanations": {
  "pulse": "output pulse signal of the PWM module that is driven high while an internal counter is below a computed threshold and low otherwise"
},
"Logical Operators": ["|->", "~", "s_eventually"],
"Logical Operators Explanation": {
  "|->": "if the left‚Äêside condition holds, then the property on the right must eventually become true in subsequent clock cycles",
  "~": "logical negation that inverts a Boolean value",
  "s_eventually": "a temporal operator indicating that the contained condition is required to occur at some future clock cycle"
},
"Assertion Explaination": "since a condition that is always true holds, it mandates that eventually the condition where the inversion of the output pulse signal becomes true must be satisfied"
}
