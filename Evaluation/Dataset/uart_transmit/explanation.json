    "Assertion Explaination": "using a logical OR operator, the assertion verifies that either the signal responsible for initializing the module is at its active state, or the internal indicator confirms that the transmission is not active; in other words, it ensures that eventually the module is either being reset or remains in the idle state required by the design"
