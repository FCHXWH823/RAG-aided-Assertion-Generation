    },
    "Assertion Explaination": "it is eventually ensured that either the reset input signal is equal to its active value as determined by an equality check, or the display enable signal is equal to its active value as determined by an equality check; the OR operation combines these conditions so that if one holds, the overall requirement is satisfied"
