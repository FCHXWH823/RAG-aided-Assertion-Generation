      "s_eventually": "a temporal operator indicating that the contained condition is required to occur at some future clock cycle (eventually)",
      "||": "logical OR, meaning at least one operand must be true",

    "Assertion Explaination": "eventually, either the reset condition becomes true, or the condition indicating that the SCL line is not enabled becomes true, or the condition that clock stretching is active becomes true"
