// Module: simple_pipeline
// Description: This module takes 8 WIDTH-bit inputs, multiplies the 4 pairs,
// and then sums the products using a 2-level adder tree. Each stage of the
// pipeline is registered, and all overflow is ignored at each stage.

//===================================================================
// Parameter Description
// WIDTH : The data width (number of bits) of the input and output
//===================================================================

//===================================================================
// Interface Description
// clk  : Clock input
// rst  : Reset input (active high)
// in   : An array of 8 WIDTH-bit inputs
// valid_in : User should assert any time the input data on ""in"" is valid.
// out  : The output of the multiply accumulate computation.
// valid_out : Asserted whenever ""out"" contains valid data.

// Revision 1.2  2001/09/11 14:17:00  mohor
// Few little NCSIM warnings fixed.
//
// Revision 1.1  2001/08/06 14:44:29  mohor
// A define FPGA added to select between Artisan RAM (for ASIC) and Block Ram (For Virtex).
// Include files fixed to contain no path.
// File names and module names changed ta have a eth_ prologue in the name.
// File eth_timescale.v is used to define timescale
// All pin names on the top module are changed to contain _I, _O or _OE at the end.
// Bidirectional signal MDIO is changed to three signals (Mdc_O, Mdi_I, Mdo_O
// and Mdo_OE. The bidirectional signal must be created on the top level. This
// is done due to the ASIC tools.
//
// Revision 1.1  2001/07/30 21:23:42  mohor
// Directory structure changed. Files checked and joind together.
//
// Revision 1.2  2001/07/03 12:55:41  mohor
// Minor changes because of the synthesys warnings.
//
//
// Revision 1.1  2001/06/27 21:26:19  mohor
// Initial release of the RxEthMAC module.

//  Turns memory access requests from the execute stage and     //
//  instruction and data caches into wishbone bus cycles.       //
//  For 4-word read requests from either cache and swap         //
//  accesses ( read followed by write to the same address)      //
//  from the execute stage, a block transfer is done.           //
//  All other requests result in single word transfers.         //
//                                                              //
//  Write accesses can be done in a single clock cycle on       //
//  the wishbone bus, is the destination allows it. The         //
//  next transfer will begin immediately on the                 //
//  next cycle on the bus. This looks like a block transfer     //
//  and does hold ownership of the wishbone bus, preventing     //
//  the other master ( the ethernet MAC) from gaining           //
//  ownership between those two cycles. But otherwise it would  //
//  be necessary to insert a wait cycle after every write,      //
//  slowing down the performance of the core by around 5 to     //
//  10%.                                                        //
