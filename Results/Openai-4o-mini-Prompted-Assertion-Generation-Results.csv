### Explanation of Assertions:
- **Assertion 1** ensures that the `out` signal from the DUT matches the first element in the `reference_queue` at every rising edge of the clock.
  
- **Assertion 2** checks that whenever the `rst` signal goes high, all elements of `reference_queue` are set to the `RESET_VALUE`. The expected length is the number of cycles defined in the testbench.

- **Assertion 3** verifies that the length of the `reference_queue` does not exceed `CYCLES`, which helps in ensuring the queue remains within its allocated bounds.

Feel free to adjust the expected output or add more assertions based on specific functional requirements!"

### Explanation of the Assertions:

**Assertion 1:** 
This assertion checks that the output (`out`) of the delay module matches the input (`in`) after being delayed by `CYCLES` on the rising edge of `clk`. It is only active if the reset signal (`rst`) is low and the delay cycle count (`count`) is at least `CYCLES`. If the condition fails, it triggers a fatal error that displays the cycle count and simulation time.

**Assertion 2:** 
This assertion checks that when the delay count (`count`) equals `CYCLES`, the output (`out`) of the delay module should match the specified `RESET_VALUE`. If this condition is not met, it triggers a fatal error showing the simulation time.

These assertions can help in verifying the correctness of timing and reset behavior in your delay system."

Checks that whenever the signal in is true on a clock cycle (at the rising edge of clk), the signal out must be true in the following clock cycle and this assertion is only evaluated on the rising edge of clk and is disabled (not checked) when the rst signal is asserted (i.e., rst is high). 
This assertion should be in the format:
```assert property(xxxx)```

Assertion 2:
Check to make sure the reset is working correctly. Technically, this is checking for an synchronous reset because it checks to see if out is not asserted on every rising edge after rst is 1.
This assertion should be in the format:
```assert property(xxxx)```

Assertion 3:
Check for the asynchronous reset, i.e., when rst is 1, out signal should be 0.
This assertion should be in the format:
```
always @(rst) begin  
      assert(xxxx);

### Explanation of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1**: Uses the implication operator (`|->`) which checks that if `in` is true on the rising edge of `clk`, then `out` must also be true in the next clock cycle, except when `rst` is asserted (high). This ensures that the condition is only checked when reset is not active.

2. **Assertion 2**: Similar to Assertion 1 but evaluates the output `out` on every rising edge of `clk` after `rst` is set to high. This ensures that `out` remains low during the reset period, confirming proper synchronous reset behavior.

3. **Assertion 3**: An always block that checks that when `rst` is high, `out` must be low, which is expected behavior for an asynchronous reset. 

By including these assertions, the testbench helps verify that the flip-flop operates correctly under the specified conditions related to reset signals and input signals."

### Explanation of Assertions:
- **Assertion 1**: This checks that if the enable signal (`en`) is asserted and reset (`rst`) is not asserted, then the output (`out`) matches the input (`in`) from the previous clock cycle.
  
- **Assertion 2**: This checks that if the enable signal is not asserted (`!en`), the output (`out`) retains its previous value using the `$past` function.

- **Assertion 3**: Similar to Assertion 2, but this time it makes use of the `$stable` function to ensure that the output does not change when the enable signal is not asserted.

- **Assertion 4**: This checks that when the reset signal (`rst`) is high, the output should be zero immediately after a 1 time unit delay."

### Explanation of Assertions:
- **Assertion 1 & 2**: These assertions are placed inside an `always` block checking conditions when the clock is at its positive edge to prevent writing to a full FIFO or reading from an empty FIFO.
- **Assertion 3**: This property assertion ensures that if the write signal is valid (`DUT.valid_wr`), then the full signal must not be high.
- **Assertion 4**: Similarly, it ensures that if the read signal is valid (`DUT.valid_rd`), then the empty signal must not be high.
- **Assertion 5 & 6**: These properties make sure that when a write or read is occurring, the FIFO is not in a state that contradicts that operation being performed (i.e., checking `full` and `empty` states)."

### Explanation of Assertions:

1. **Assertion 1**: Ensures that when a write enable (`wr_en`) signal is high and the FIFO is full, the condition is false. If it ever becomes true, an error message is printed with the current simulation time.

2. **Assertion 2**: Similar to Assertion 1 but for the read operation. It checks that when the read enable (`rd_en`) signal is high and the FIFO is empty, the condition is false, and if it becomes true, it prints an error message.

3. **Assertion 3**: It first saves the `wr_data` to a local variable `data` when there is a valid write. The property then asserts that at some point in the future, if a read operation (`rd_en`) is performed while the FIFO is not empty, the read data (`rd_data`) should match the previously written data. If this condition fails, a message is printed along with the mismatched read data."

### Explanation of the Assertions:
- **Assertion 1**: This checks that during a positive clock edge, if the FIFO is full, there must not be a write (`wr_en` should be low).
  
- **Assertion 2**: Similarly, it ensures that during a positive clock edge, if the FIFO is empty, there must not be a read (`rd_en` should be low).
  
- **Assertion 3**: This verifies that whenever there is a valid write (indicated by `wr_en` set to high and `tag_valid` set to 1), there will eventually be a read (`rd_en` is high) that corresponds to the tag of that write. After one clock cycle, the data read (`rd_data`) should match the data written (`wr_data`).

Make sure to adjust any signal names depending on the actual implementation and simulation environment you might be using with the FIFO module."

### Explanation of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1**: This assertion checks that when there is an active write enable (`wr_en`) and the FIFO is full (`full`), it will trigger a fatal error. This ensures that no write operations occur when the FIFO is unable to accept more data.

2. **Assertion 2**: This assertion checks that when there is an active read enable (`rd_en`) and the FIFO is empty (`empty`), it will similarly trigger a fatal error. This prevents attempts to read from an empty FIFO.

3. **Assertion 3**: This assertion validates that the read data (`rd_data`) matches the expected first element of data (`correct_rd_data`) from the FIFO when a read operation is performed. This ensures that the correct data is being outputted during a read operation.

### Note:
In practical implementations, `correct_rd_data` should be updated at appropriate places in the design to reflect the expected output after write operations have occurred. The assertions assume that `DUT` correctly implements the FIFO behavior."

### Explanation of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1** checks the output of the assign-based multiplexer (`DUT_ASSIGN`) after setting `sel` to select `in0`. It ensures that `out_assign` matches `in0`.
   
2. **Assertion 2** checks the output of the assign-based multiplexer (`DUT_ASSIGN`) again after changing the selection to switch to `in1`.

3. Additional assertions for the other DUTs are provided to ensure correctness based on the current selection. Each assertion uses the same logic to verify that the output matches the expected value based on whether `sel` is set to select `in0` or `in1`. 

You can further expand the testbench to include more comprehensive test patterns as needed."

### Notes:
1. **Assertions:** Assertions are added in the Verilog code, where each property corresponds to the respective conditions as described.
2. **Output Message:** Each assertion failure includes a fatal message indicating what assertion failed for easier debugging.
3. **Immediate Assertion:** The immediate assertion checks if `out` equals 0 whenever `rst` is 1 by using an implication inside the `always` block.
4. **Use of `|=>`:** The `|=>` syntax is used for specifying implication in SVA, meaning the left condition must occur before the right condition in the following clock cycle."

### Description of Assertions:
- **Assertion 1:** This assertion checks that when `rst` is low (0) and `en` is high (1), the output `out` equals the value of the input `in` at the previous clock edge.
  
- **Assertion 2:** This assertion checks that when `rst` is low (0) and `en` is low (0), the output `out` equals the `out` value from the previous cycle.

- **Assertion 3:** This assertion checks that when `rst` is low (0) and `en` is low (0), the output `out` remains unchanged compared to the previous cycle.

- **Assertion 4:** This is an immediate assertion that verifies that when `rst` is high (1), the output `out` must equal 0."

### Notes:
1. **LATENCY Constant:** Ensure you define `LATENCY` correctly according to your `simple_pipeline` implementation.
2. **Input Index:** In Assertion 1, replace `in[valid_in]` with the appropriate indexing into your `in` array based on how your design expects the input.
3. **Logical Conditions:** The assertions assume that during a reset (`rst == 1`), the output and validity states are managed properly. Make sure your pipeline logic aligns with these expectations.
4. **Timing:** `## N` indicates a delay of `N` clock cycles; make sure these delays correspond to the actual latency and behavior of your pipeline design."

 Please generate a rewritten version of it, which contains several useful assertions and each of them follows a description as follows:Assertion 1:
This assertion is to check only when rst is 0 that once the pipeline reaches its defined latency (DUT.LATENCY), the output (out) matches the expected value produced by the model function based on the values of in from DUT.LATENCY cycles ago when en was high.
This assertion should be with the format:
```
assert property (xxxx)
```

Assertion 2:
This assertion is to check only when rst is 0 that valid_out remains low until DUT.LATENCY clocks has gone, meaning no valid output is produced prematurely.
This assertion should be with the format:
```
assert property (xxxx)
```

Assertion 3:
This assertion is to check only when rst is 0 that valid_out matches valid_in from DUT.LATENCY cycles ago, taking into account when the pipeline was enabled (en was high).
This assertion should be with the format:
```
assert property (xxxx)
```

Assertion 4:
This assertion is to check only when rst is 0 that out remains zero until DUT.LATENCY clocks has gone.
This assertion should be with the format:
```
assert property (xxxx)
```

","Below is the modified Verilog code snippet that includes the specified assertions alongside the original testbench logic. Each assertion is written according to the descriptions provided:

```verilog
module simple_pipeline_with_en_tb;

   localparam int NUM_TESTS = 10000;
   localparam int WIDTH = 8;
   localparam int LATENCY = 3; // Assuming some latency value for the pipeline, adjust as necessary.
      
   logic          clk, rst, en, valid_in, valid_out;
   logic [WIDTH-1:0] in[8];
   logic [WIDTH-1:0] out;
    
   simple_pipeline_with_en #(.WIDTH(WIDTH)) DUT (.*);

   initial begin : generate_clock
      clk = 1'b0;
      while (1) #5 clk = ~clk;      
   end

   initial begin
      $timeformat(-9, 0, "" ns"");

      rst <= 1'b1;
      en <= 1'b0;      
      valid_in <= 1'b0;
      for (int i=0; i < 8; i++) in[i] <= '0;
      for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) @(posedge clk);
      @(negedge clk);
      rst <= 1'b0;
      @(posedge clk);
 
      for (int i=0; i < NUM_TESTS; i++) begin
         en <= $random;  
         for (int i=0; i < 8; i++) in[i] <= $random;
         valid_in <= $random;    
         @(posedge clk);
      end

      $display(""Tests completed."");      
      disable generate_clock;
   end

   // Assertions
   // Assertion 1: Check output matches expected value after defined latency
   assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff(rst) 
                   (en == 1'b1) |-> (out == expected_value(in, $past(in), LATENCY))
                   ) 
   else $error(""Output does not match expected value after latency!"");

   // Assertion 2: Check valid_out does not go high prematurely
   assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff(rst)
                   (valid_out == 1'b0) throughout (LATENCY)
                   )
   else $error(""valid_out went high before LATENCY cycles!"");

   // Assertion 3: Check valid_out matches valid_in from LATENCY cycles ago
   assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff(rst)
                   (valid_out == $past(valid_in, LATENCY))
                   )
   else $error(""valid_out does not match valid_in from LATENCY cycles ago!"");

   // Assertion 4: Check output remains zero until LATENCY clocks have passed
   assert property (@(posedge clk) disable iff(rst)
                   (out == '0) throughout (LATENCY)
                   )
   else $error(""Output is not zero until LATENCY cycles have passed!"");

   // Function to calculate expected value (for Assertion 1)
   function automatic logic [WIDTH-1:0] expected_value(
       input logic [WIDTH-1:0] in, 
       input logic [WIDTH-1:0] last_in[V],
       input int latency);
       // Define how to compute expected value based on the pipeline's behavior
       // This should be replaced with the actual logic according to DUT functionality
       return last_in[latency]; // Example function logic
   endfunction

endmodule
```

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `LATENCY` parameter and expected value calculation are defined correctly as per your DUT's behavior.
- The `expected_value` function in Assertion 1 needs to be implemented with proper logic to calculate the expected output based on the input values and your pipeline's logic.
- The assertions leverage SystemVerilog properties syntax and simplify checking the conditions during simulation.
- The comments detail each assertion purpose, maintaining clarity and purpose in the testbench code."
