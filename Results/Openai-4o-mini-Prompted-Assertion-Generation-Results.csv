### Explanation of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1:** This assertion ensures that at every rising edge of the clock, the output of the delay module (`out`) matches the expected value from `reference_queue[0]`.

2. **Assertion 2:** This assertion checks that when the reset signal (`rst`) is active, the output (`out`) is set to `RESET_VALUE`. If not, it raises an error.

3. **Assertion 3:** This assertion verifies that the output (`out`) only updates correctly when the enable signal (`en`) is high. If `en` is not high, the output should not reflect new input changes.

These assertions are placed within the appropriate always_ff blocks to ensure they are evaluated in the correct simulation context."

### Explanation of Assertions:
- **Assertion 1:**
  - This assertion checks that after `CYCLES` have elapsed, the output `out` matches the input `in` when there's a positive edge on the clock (`clk`), provided the reset signal (`rst`) is not active. If the assertion fails, it will display a fatal error message.
  
- **Assertion 2:**
  - This assertion ensures that after `count` equals `CYCLES`, the output (`out`) should be equal to the `RESET_VALUE`. If the output does not match the expected value, a fatal error will be raised.

These assertions help in verifying the functionality of the delay module by checking the expected behavior against certain conditions throughout the simulation."

Checks that whenever the signal in is true on a clock cycle (at the rising edge of clk), the signal out must be true in the following clock cycle and this assertion is only evaluated on the rising edge of clk and is disabled (not checked) when the rst signal is asserted (i.e., rst is high). 
Assertion 2:
Check to make sure the reset is working correctly. Technically, this is checking for an synchronous reset because it checks to see if out is not asserted on every rising edge after rst is 1. 
Assertion 3:
Check for the asynchronous reset, i.e., when rst is 1, out signal should be 0.

### Explanation of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1**: This assertion checks that if `in` is true during a clock cycle, `out` must be true in the next clock cycle. It only evaluates if `rst` is not asserted (i.e., `rst` is low).
   
2. **Assertion 2**: This assertion ensures that the output `out` is not asserted (i.e., it should be low) on every clock cycle whenever `rst` is high. This is testing the synchronous reset behavior of the design.

3. **Assertion 3**: This assertion validates that when `rst` is high (asynchronous reset), `out` should be zero. This tests the immediate effect of the reset without requiring a clock cycle. 

Make sure the corresponding functionality in the `ff` module supports these assertions for proper testing."

### Explanation of the assertions added:

1. **Assertion 1: Output equals input when enable is asserted**  
   This checks that the output of the flip-flop (`out`) is equal to the input (`in`) from one cycle back, but only when the enable signal (`en`) is active.

2. **Assertions 2-3: Output stability when enable is not asserted**  
   Both assertions ensure that the output does not change on the rising edge of the clock when the enable signal is inactive. The first uses `$stable` to check if `out` remains the same while the second checks that `out` is equal to its previous value using `$past`.

3. **Assertion 4: Asynchronous reset behavior**  
   This assertion checks that when the reset signal (`rst`) is asserted, the output (`out`) should be `0`.

These assertions capture the intended behavior of the flip-flop (`DUT`) and help in verifying the correctness of the design against the specified requirements."

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Assertions 1 and 2** are included in the first `always` block that activates on the positive edge of `clk`. These assertions ensure that if a write (`wr_en`) is attempted when the FIFO is full, or if a read (`rd_en`) is attempted when the FIFO is empty, a fatal error occurs.
  
- **Assertions 3 and 4** are added to check the conditions related to `DUT.valid_wr` and `full`, as well as `DUT.valid_rd` and `empty`, validating that both conditions cannot be true simultaneously.

- **Assertions 5 and 6** are added again to ensure that if `DUT.valid_wr` is high, then `full` must not be high, and similarly for `rd_en` using `empty`.

These assertions will help ensure that the FIFO operates correctly during the testbench simulation."

### Explanation of the Assertions:
- **Assertion 1:** Checks that a write operation does not occur when the FIFO is full. If this occurs, it generates a fatal error with the current simulation time.
- **Assertion 2:** Ensures that a read operation does not occur when the FIFO is empty. Similar to the first, this assertion generates a fatal message if triggered.
- **Assertion 3:** Defines a property that asserts that after a valid write (when `wr_en` is high and the FIFO is not full), there must eventually be a valid read (`rd_en` is high, FIFO is not empty) that retrieves the same data that was written. If the condition is violated, it prints a warning message.

### Notes:
1. **Tagging Logic**: The code initializes a tagging system with `wr_tag` and `serving_tag` to correlate writes and reads.
2. **FIFO Properties Assertions**: Assertions check that there are no writes when the FIFO is full, and no reads when the FIFO is empty. If these conditions are violated, the simulation halts with a fatal error.
3. **Value Matching Assertion**: The code checks if the data read matches what was written using the tags. The assertion is invoked based on the unique tags assigned on writes.
4. **Error Handling**: If the assertions fail, detailed error messages assist in debugging.

This framework provides a practical approach to verify FIFO behavior and correlates the relationship between writes and reads."

### Explanation of the added assertions:

1. **Assertion 1**: This check verifies that a write operation does not occur when the FIFO is full. If `wr_en` is true and `full` is true on the rising edge of `clk`, it logs an error.

2. **Assertion 2**: Similar to the first assertion, this ensures that a read operation does not occur when the FIFO is empty. If `rd_en` is true and `empty` is true, it logs an error.

3. **Assertion 3**: This assertion checks if the `rd_data` matches the expected `correct_rd_data`, which is assumed to be the first element written to the FIFO. If it does not match, an error is logged indicating the mismatch. 

These assertions enhance the verification of the FIFO behavior by checking essential FIFO operating conditions and data correctness."

### Description of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1** checks if the output of the DUT (`DUT_ASSIGN`) matches the expected output based on the multiplexing logic where `expected_out` is determined using the select line.
2. **Assertion 2** verifies the output of the DUT (`DUT_IF`) against `expected_out`.
3. **Assertion 3** evaluates the output of the DUT (`DUT_IF2`) to ensure it also matches `expected_out`.
4. **Assertion 4** checks the output of the DUT (`DUT_CASE`) for correctness compared to `expected_out`.

Each assertion is designed to trigger an error message if the outputs do not match the expected values, aiding in debugging the implementation of each multiplexer."

2. **Assertion 2**: It's a duplicate of Assertion 1, following your initial instructions. Ensure to have distinct checks if intended.
3. **Assertion 3**: Validates that the output is zero during the positive edge of the clock when reset is high (`rst` = 1).
4. **Assertion 4**: An immediate assertion within an always block that checks whether the output is zero whenever the reset signal is asserted.

This allows for comprehensive verification of the register behavior during its operation with respect to the reset signal."

### Description of the Assertions:
- **Assertion 1:** This assertion checks at the positive edge of `clk` if `rst` is `0` and `en` is `1`, and validates that the output `out` matches the input `in`. If the assertion fails, an error message is printed.
  
- **Assertion 2:** This assertion is also evaluated at the positive edge of `clk`. It checks if `rst` is `0` and `en` is `0`. It verifies that `out` remains the same as the previous value without raising an error.

- **Assertion 3:** This assertion confirms that the output `out` does not change when `rst` is `0` and `en` is `0`. The condition checks ensure that the output must retain its original value, and it uses the `===` operator to confirm no change.

- **Assertion 4:** This immediate assertion checks that when `rst` is `1`, the output `out` is `0`. It checks its condition independently of the `clk` and raises an error if the condition fails. 

These assertions help ensure the correctness of the `register` functionality under specified conditions during simulation."

### Explanation of Assertions:
1. **Assertion 1**: It checks that, once `rst` is low and the pipeline has reached the specified latency, the output (`out`) matches the expected output from `LATENCY` cycles back.
  
2. **Assertion 2**: It checks that `valid_out` remains low until the latency is reached, ensuring proper signal propagation.

3. **Assertion 3**: It asserts that `valid_out` matches `valid_in` from the appropriate number of cycles earlier, maintaining expected behavior of the pipeline.

4. **Assertion 4**: It ensures that `out` remains low until after the pipeline latency has been reached, expanding on the requirement for `output` behavior.

### Note:
- Ensure that you define `LATENCY` accurately based on your implementation of the `simple_pipeline`. 
- You may need to manage the `i` variable and increment it in your loop to track the number of cycles effectively for the assertions. In the example, `i` management is abstracted; you can use a dedicated counter if necessary."

### Explanation of the Assertions:
- **Assertion 1:** Ensures that after the defined latency, the output matches the expected value from a model function based on the past input.
- **Assertion 2:** Ensures that `valid_out` does not become high until after the defined latency.
- **Assertion 3:** Checks that the `valid_out` matches the `valid_in` from `LATENCY` cycles prior, only when enabled.
- **Assertion 4:** Verifies that the output remains zero until the defined latency has passed.

### Note:
- The code assumes a model function for calculating the expected output based on input; this function needs to be defined elsewhere in the testbench or module.
- Adjust the `LATENCY` parameter according to the actual design of `simple_pipeline_with_en` to match any latency defined in that module."
