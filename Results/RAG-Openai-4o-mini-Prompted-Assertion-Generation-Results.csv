 Please generate a rewritten version of it, which contains several useful assertions and each of them follows a description as follows:Assertion 1:
Checks that whenever the signal in is true on a clock cycle (at the rising edge of clk), the signal out must be true in the following clock cycle and this assertion is only evaluated on the rising edge of clk and is disabled (not checked) when the rst signal is asserted (i.e., rst is high). 
This assertion should be in the format:
```assert property(xxxx)```

Assertion 2:
Check to make sure the reset is working correctly. Technically, this is checking for an synchronous reset because it checks to see if out is not asserted on every rising edge after rst is 1.
This assertion should be in the format:
```assert property(xxxx)```

Assertion 3:
Check for the asynchronous reset, i.e., when rst is 1, out signal should be 0.
This assertion should be in the format:
```
always @(rst) begin  
      assert(xxxx);      
end
```

 Please generate a rewritten version of it, which contains several useful assertions and each of them follows a description as follows:Assertion 1-2:
To check certain FIFO properties, the two asserions see inside of the FIFO module. They are used to check to make sure that when clk is at posedge, there is never a write while the FIFO is full, or a read while the FIFO is empty. 
This assertion should be with the format:
```
assert property (xxxx)
```

Assertion 3:
It first creates a property where if there is a valid write, we save the wr_data into the local data variable data. The valid write then implies that at some indefinite point in the future (i.e. ##[1:$]) there will be a valid read (i.e., rd_en is 1 and the FIFO is not empty) from the FIFO that has matching data .Then, this assertion checks whether the property can be satisfied and if it is satisfied, it will print a custom message containing the current time and rd_data.
This assertion should be with the format:
```
assert property (xxxx)
```
