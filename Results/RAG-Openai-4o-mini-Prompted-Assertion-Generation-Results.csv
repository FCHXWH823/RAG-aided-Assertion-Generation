 Please generate a rewritten version of it, which contains several useful assertions and each of them follows a description as follows:Assertion 1:
Checks that whenever the signal in is true on a clock cycle (at the rising edge of clk), the signal out must be true in the following clock cycle and this assertion is only evaluated on the rising edge of clk and is disabled (not checked) when the rst signal is asserted (i.e., rst is high). 
Assertion 2:
Check to make sure the reset is working correctly. Technically, this is checking for an synchronous reset because it checks to see if out is not asserted on every rising edge after rst is 1. 
Assertion 3:
Check for the asynchronous reset, i.e., when rst is 1, out signal should be 0.

- Assertions 2 and 3 ensure that the output remains stable when the enable signal is not asserted.

These assertions will help validate the functionality of your flip-flop design during the testbench execution."

 Please generate a rewritten version of it, which contains several useful assertions and each of them follows a description as follows:Assertion 1-2:
To check certain FIFO properties, the two asserions see inside of the FIFO module. They are used to check to make sure that when clk is at posedge, there is never a write while the FIFO is full, or a read while the FIFO is empty. 
Assertion 3:
It first creates a property where if there is a valid write, we save the wr_data into the local data variable data. The valid write then implies that at some indefinite point in the future (i.e. ##[1:$]) there will be a valid read (i.e., rd_en is 1 and the FIFO is not empty) from the FIFO that has matching data .Then, this assertion checks whether the property can be satisfied and if it is satisfied, it will print a custom message containing the current time and rd_data.
","Here is the rewritten version of your FIFO testbench with the requested assertions:

```verilog
module fifo_tb2;

   localparam WIDTH = 8;
   localparam DEPTH = 16;

   end

   initial begin
      $timeformat(-9, 0, "" ns"");
      rst <= 1'b1;
      rd_en <= 1'b0;
      wr_en <= 1'b0;
      wr_data <= '0;      
      for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) @(posedge clk);
      @(negedge clk);
      rst <= 1'b0;

      for (int i=0; i < 10000; i++) begin
         wr_data <= $random;
         wr_en <= $random;
         rd_en <= $random;
         @(posedge clk);        
      end

      disable generate_clock;
      $display(""Tests Completed."");      
   end  

   // Assertion 1: Check for write when FIFO is full
   always @(posedge clk) begin
      assert (!full || !wr_en) else $error(""Write attempted when FIFO is full at time %t"", $time);
   end

   // Assertion 2: Check for read when FIFO is empty
   always @(posedge clk) begin
      assert (!empty || !rd_en) else $error(""Read attempted when FIFO is empty at time %t"", $time);
   end

   // Assertion 3: Valid write implies future valid read with matching data
   logic [WIDTH-1:0] data;
   property write_then_read;
      @(posedge clk) (wr_en && !full) |-> ##[1:$] (rd_en && !empty && (data === rd_data));
   endproperty

   // Assertion to check the above property and print message
   assert property (write_then_read) else $error(""Valid write followed by read with matching data failed at time %t. Expected: %h, Got: %h"", $time, data, rd_data);

   // Capture written data for the assertion
   always @(posedge clk) begin
      if (wr_en && !full) begin
         data <= wr_data; // Store data on valid write
      end
   end
  
endmodule
```

In this version, I have added three assertions as per your requirements. The first two assertions check for violations of FIFO properties during the positive edge of the clock, ensuring that writes do not occur when the FIFO is full and reads do not occur when the FIFO is empty. The third assertion checks that if a write occurs, a corresponding read with matching data must follow at some point in the future."

In this code, I've added several assertions based on your requirements. The assertions are designed to check the state of the signals under the specified conditions while the reset signal (`rst`) is low. Adjustments may be necessary based on the actual behavior of your `simple_pipeline` design and the exact timing you want the assertions to check."
