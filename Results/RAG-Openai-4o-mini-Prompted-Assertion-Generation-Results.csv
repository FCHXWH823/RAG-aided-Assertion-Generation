Assertion 3:
This assertion is a bit more complex and checks the integrity of data through the FIFO. It specifies that if data is written to the FIFO (wr_en && !full), and this data (data=wr_data) is captured at the time of writing, then eventually, when a read enable (rd_en) occurs and the FIFO is not empty (!empty), the data read out (rd_data) should match the data that was written in. This sequence uses a non-blocking timing delay (##[1:$]), allowing any number of cycles between the write and the corresponding read, but ensuring the read happens when conditions are met. It also displays a message upon successful verification of this property.

Assertion 3:
The assertion verifies that whenever a read operation occurs (rd_en && !empty), the data read from the FIFO (rd_data) should match the data (correct_rd_data) that was expected to be read based on the FIFO's operation modeled in the reference array.
